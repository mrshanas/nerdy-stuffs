# 2022

I can say this was a good year to me, so many things happened and I'm grateful I've learnt alot along the way

## Achievements

### Deployed my first project

I was learning [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) and I wanted to create a fullstack web app using this framework, so I managed to create an online inventory system called [Smartshop](https://smartshop-yqokj.ondigitalocean.app/).

### Got my first Intern Position at [Singo Africa](https://singo.africa)

In our [university](https://udsm.ac.tz) we are required to do Practical Training at each end of an academic year, so I applied at a company called [Singo Africa](https://singo.africa) and worked there for 2 months but I got also a position as an intern which am still working there up to now.
