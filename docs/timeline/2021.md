# 2021 Sad story

This is where I started interest in tech stuffs, it was after my high school studies and I had nothing to do so I used my father's PC running on Windows XP ðŸ˜… and wrote some HTML and Java codes.

I wanted to build mobile apps so I dived in with Java and it was too much for me, all the `OOP` concepts I couldn't understand how were they used in making apps, so I reached out to some experienced programmers seeking for advice and roadmaps on tech journey that is where I discovered **Python** and **JavaScript**

I bought some Udemy courses and downloaded some books related to the above mentioned programming languages, It was hard for me and I thought I had whole lotta things to learn but I never gave up because it was interesting to me and It felt like magic ðŸ˜…
